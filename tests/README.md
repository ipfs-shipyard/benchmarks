# IPFS Benchmarks

## Test descriptions

Each test uses a small file ( 200 bytes ) and large file ( 1.2 MB ) and actions on empty repo vs populated repo.

### local-add:
The time it takes to add a file using unixFS.
```js
repo.files.add(fileStream)
```
### local-extract
The total time to get a file from a repo.
```js
repo.files.get(validCID)
```
### local-transfer
The total time it takes to transfer a fie from repo A to repo B
```js
repoB.files.cat(inserted[0].hash)
```
### multi-peer-transfer
With the same file inserted into 4 peers, this test captures the time for a 5th peer to retrieve file from swarm
```js
peerE.files.cat(inserted[0].hash)
```

### init-node
Test the time to spin up a node without using pre-generated key
```js
new IPFS({
      repo: `${repoPath}${Math.random()
        .toString()
        .substring(2, 8)}`,
      config: config,
      init: init 
    })
```

### Adding new tests

- Copy test.template and give the file the name of the test
- Add test fo the async function 
- Call run() with the name of you test as param
- Add the test name and subtests to the [config/index](config/index.json).

To Test it:

```bash
> node *test-name*
```

## Use case coverage

The following tables highlight tests that are present or missing:

* 🍏 - test exists
* 🍎 - test not exists

#### Transport and Storage

* balanced - use balanced DAG strategy (the default)
* trickle - use trickle DAG strategy
* tcp - libp2p transport over TCP [js-libp2p-tcp](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-tcp)
* websocket - libp2p transport over websockets [js-libp2p-websocket-star](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-websocket-star)
* webrtc - libp2p transport over webrtc [js-libp2p-webrtc-star](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-webrtc-star)
* mplex - libp2p multiplexer [js-libp2p-mplex](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-mplex)
* spdy - libp2p multiplexer [js-libp2p-spdy](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-spdy)
* secio - libp2p connection encryption channel [js-libp2p-secio](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-secio)

#### IPFS nodes

* js0 -> js0 - A local test from one JS IPFS node to the same node
* js0 -> js1 - A test between two JS IPFS nodes
* go0 -> go0 - For comparison with js0 -> js0
* go0 -> go1 - For comparison with js0 -> js1
* js0 -> go0 - A test between a JS IPFS node and a Go IPFS node
* go0 -> js0 - For comparison with js0 -> go0
* js01234 -> js5 - A test from multiple JS IPFS nodes to a single JS IPFS node
* go01234 -> go5 - For comparison with js01234 -> js5

#### Notes

IPFS nodes in benchmark tests should:

1. Not connect to bootstrap nodes (https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs#optionsconfig)
1. Have preloading disabled (https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs#optionspreload)
1. Disable discovery

For connecting peers you'll need to use the `ipfs.swarm.connect` API.

For browser tests we need to run a rendezvous server:

* websockets - https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-websocket-star-rendezvous#usage
* webrtc - https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-webrtc-star/#rendezvous-server-aka-signalling-server

Instructions for enabling different transports in both browsers - for JS IPFS see https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs#optionslibp2p

### Future test suggestions

1. DHT (not yet in JS IPFS) - what would be a good way to test this?
1. Tests via a relay node
1. Tests for IPNS publish and resolve (not yet in JS IPFS)
